        <h2>The Story of Our Food, Our Culture, Our Family</h2>
        <p>
          Once when a Lion was asleep a little Mouse began running up and down
          upon him; this soon wakened the Lion, who placed his huge paw upon
          him, and opened his big jaws to swallow him. "Pardon, O King," cried
          the little Mouse: "forgive me this time, I shall never forget it: who
          knows but what I may be able to do you a turn some of these days?" The
          Lion was so tickled at the idea of the Mouse being able to help him,
          that he lifted up his paw and let him go.

          Once upon a time a Wolf was lapping at a spring on a hillside, when, 7
          looking up, what should he see but a Lamb just beginning to drink a
          little lower down. "There's my supper," thought he, "if only I can
          find some excuse to seize it." Then he called out to the Lamb, "How
          dare you muddle the water from which I am drinking?"

        <p>
          It happened that a Dog had got a piece of meat and was carrying it
          home in his mouth to eat it in peace. Now, on his way home he had to
          cross a plank lying across a running brook. As he crossed, he looked.

          The Lion went once a-hunting along with the Fox, the Jackal, and the
          Wolf. They hunted and they hunted till at last they surprised a Stag,
          and soon took its life. Then came the question how the spoil should be
          divided.

          Let's forget and forgive; perhaps you were right to punish my son, and
          take vengeance on my cattle, but surely I was right in trying to
          revenge him; now that we are both.
